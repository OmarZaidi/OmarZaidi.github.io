# Reflections on Software Engineering Beyond Web Development

As I reflect on the culmination of my experiences in the ICS 314 Software Engineering class, it becomes evident that my initial perception of software engineering as merely web application development has undergone a profound transformation. While the class has undoubtedly equipped me with the skills to design functional websites, the true essence lies in the fundamental software engineering concepts that extend far beyond the realm of web development. In this essay, I will delve into the significance of Coding Standards and Agile Project Management (specifically, Issue Driven Project Management - IDPM) and discuss how these concepts can be applied to diverse projects beyond the scope of web applications.

## Coding Standards: Enhancing Collaboration and Readability

Coding standards emerged as a cornerstone of effective software engineering practices during the course. In essence, coding standards define a standardized coding style within a specific discipline of computer science, fostering improved code readability, organization, and overall better coding habits. In the collaborative landscape of software engineering, where innovative projects often stem from the collective efforts of a team, coding standards play a pivotal role.

Collaboration, a hallmark of software engineering, can be challenging when each team member possesses unique coding quirks and preferences. Coding standards act as a common language, facilitating seamless collaboration and enabling developers to understand, work on, and contribute to each other's code efficiently. This collaborative benefit extends beyond software engineering, finding relevance in any environment that demands teamwork and collaboration. The enhanced readability across individuals and teams becomes indispensable for efficiency, offering a significant advantage in diverse collaborative projects.

## Agile Project Management (IDPM): A Productive Work Pace Beyond Web Development

The adoption of Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) in the final project of this course brought to light a project management style that goes beyond the traditional Agile framework. IDPM, characterized by frequent meetings, short task durations, meticulous documentation, and a structured GitHub workflow, proved to be an effective approach for organizing and managing work.

IDPM enforces a productive and non-procrastinating work pace by breaking down tasks into manageable units, ensuring regular communication, and providing a transparent overview of project progress. The use of milestones, specific branches for tasks, and a dedicated GitHub project board adds a layer of organization that is conducive to sustained productivity.

The applicability of IDPM extends well beyond web development. Its principles of regular communication, task breakdown, and transparent project tracking can be adapted to any team project. Whether in academia, business, or other collaborative ventures, IDPM offers a framework to motivate team members, maintain a structured workflow, and ensure steady progress towards project goals.

## In Conclusion: Software Engineering Principles Across Disciplines

In conclusion, the software engineering concepts explored in this class, such as coding standards and IDPM, transcend the boundaries of web development. These principles, dedicated to improving teamwork and ensuring consistency and efficiency, can be applied across various subjects and industries. The ability to collaborate effectively, manage time and progress, and uphold coding standards proves invaluable beyond the discipline of software engineering, making the knowledge gained in this class universally applicable and beneficial. As I conclude this semester, I carry with me not just the technical skills for web development but a broader understanding of software engineering principles that will undoubtedly shape my approach to diverse projects in the future.
