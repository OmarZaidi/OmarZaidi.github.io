## Coding Challenge

Completing my first WOD (Workout of the Day) in the ICS 314 class was like stepping into a thrilling coding adventure. As I stared at lines of code, excitement and fear coursed through me simultaneously. The challenge was to navigate through complex logic and deliver a solution under a ticking clock.

Here's the JavaScript code for the challenge:

<script type="text/javascript">
        function name() {
            for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                if ((i % 6 == 0) && (i % 4 == 0)) {
                    console.log("Bert");
                } else if (i % 6 == 0) {
                    console.log("Ernie");
                } else if (i % 4 == 0) {
                    console.log("BertErnie");
                }
                console.log(i.toString());
            }
        }
        name();
    </script>
