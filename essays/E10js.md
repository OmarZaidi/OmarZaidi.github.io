## In the context of programming

*Shaking off the dust*

Javascript has been enjoyable this past week, in fact,  it was the first language I was exposed to. I didn't get that deep into the syntax as we have in the last few days, but I was reminded of how variable management is simple, compared to C++! Outside of syntax, I also noticed how much web support there was for JS, countless online REPL’s and loads of documentation and tutorials. With all that said, Javascript seems like a good language for web development, from what I’ve seen these few weeks.  

I found the concept of athletic programming to be a great idea. Despite it causing stress and anxiety, it creates an incentive as well as simulating some possible real world scenarios where time is crucial. It challenges coding ability on a lot of different levels, problem solving, implementation, stress management, and even your typing chops! As long as I continue practicing the WODs I feel I should have a good opportunity to succeed and learn.
