## Introduction

When I first embarked on my journey to learn programming, Ruby was one of the languages that piqued my interest due to its simplicity and elegance. As I delved into the world of coding, I decided to build a basic command-line application in Ruby to manage a collection of movies and their ratings. This endeavor marked my first exposure to the Ruby programming language, and it turned out to be an excellent learning experience.

The Ruby code I developed serves as a simple movie rating app. It allows users to perform several key actions: adding movies to their collection, updating movie ratings, displaying the entire collection, and deleting movies. Let's dive into how the code achieves these functionalities.
