As an IT specialist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I work with clients, providing creative solutions to large and small scale needs for project support. While my strongest skills are on the technical side, I enjoy opportunities to aid projects through management and teaching. I aim to better my community and others at large, and plan to complete my degree in computer science/philosophy. By leveraging engineering, business, ethics and finance skills, I hope to reach those in need in the ever technologically oriented future. I enjoy dialogues on just about anything from philosophy to health and music. Feel free to reach out and discuss any of my experiences.",
